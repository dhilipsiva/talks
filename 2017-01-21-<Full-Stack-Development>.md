# I have no idea what I am talking about :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

## What is Full Stack Development?

Both Web & Mobile

# You are almost right...

Someone who is capable on working on all the layers of the Stack 
* Understand Requirements
* Plan & Architect
* Write Code (Backend + Frontend / Mobile)
* Write Doc
* Write Tests
* Deploy & Monitor

---

# So, basically...
## A Full-Stack Developer is someone who is capable of taking an Idea from inception to a usable / working product, all by himself.
